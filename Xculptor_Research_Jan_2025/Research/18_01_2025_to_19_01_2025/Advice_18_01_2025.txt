Create a elaborate CustomError function that should ask for the Function
When a custom error is thrown, then it should capture (Function, User, FileName, Session, Timestamp)

What all do we need to capture when throwing an error.
Error should be logged automatically when it is thrown.
Ensure that we don't have to manually log errors in each function.

1) The logging of error should happen at one place.
2) When logging an error we should have the following data: (Function, User, FileName, Session, Timestamp, etc).
3) Clear definition of when to log an error and when to not log an error -> DONE

Whenever there is an error, it is handled in the error handler -> error log entry -> response to user.

Error -> Error class of JS -> CustomError
Look at what to handle and what not to handle.

4)The logger should not be open ended. Middleware to do standarsized logging and should be more scalable and not dependednt on manual log entries.
5) Info-related response messages have to be standardized. Eg - Collections, Showcases (2 different controllers written by 2 different programmers -> Middleware.)
