Exception -> If the operation doesn't have the excepted result.
One of the exception types is Error.
Any function O/P that is unexpected is an exception.
Any unexpected I/P to a function 
Any function behavior that is unexpected is a warning.

When we are expecting an O/P from a function ->
1) I get an O/P -> O/P can come in a particular form / time. There are some conditions for the output that're not being met. 

If the exception is of type warning, then we continue to run and still send the output to the customer.
If something hasn't been tagged as an error, what do we do?
When do I log an info ? When do i log an error ? When do I log a warning?

DEF:
Every instance of running of a function -> info.
Info -> By default, records everything. If any deviations are there, those will also be recorded as a warning.

1) How and when I should log an info,; how and when I should log a warning; How and when I should log an error?
2) 3 appropriate middlewares for each fn -> info, error and warning.
3) In case of info and warning, we keep running the program, 

A mock controller function that monitors the entire program and decides when to log warning, info and error.
