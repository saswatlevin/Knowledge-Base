The ValidationRequest function checks if the validators have returned any errors or not.
The express.json() middleware parses the JSON request body. It does this by converting the string request body to a JS object.
Without loading the express.json() middleware, express-validator will throw errors since it can't work with a string request body.
The exists() validator merely checks if a field contains an undefined value. It has checkFalsy and the checkNull options. The former checks only if a value is null, the latter checks if a value is undefined, null or false or 0.

The validateRequestSchema function middleware validates the request body using validationResult() and throws an error (with the errors.array()) if validation fails.

The schema can be kept in a separate file.

Pass the schema and schemaValidation middleware to the route.  

a@xyz.com -> 9
abc@xyz.com -> 11
