We have a large number of objects -> Eg - Icons, banners, images, etc.
                                     Eg - 3D Objects -> .GLB Files [In Object Server].
1) What kind of validation we need for 3D Objects and images, banners, etc?
2) What are the network related validations ? -> Authenticate, Authorise
Eg -> A) Request for data point / URL which the user hasn't authorised
      B) File Not Found (404), Invalid Path
      C) Server is unreachable (Connection Issue)

Find libraries / resources to take care of handling these kinds of errors -> Add to flowchart.
Separate discussion on authorisation -> Business Logic
Eg - A brand has a 3D asset on our website, and they are integrating that into their website and their backend will send a request to ours to access that. That 3D asset should only be made available to that brand.

Error Logging, Info Logging -> Logging libraries.

=============LOG MGMT SYSTEM=======
LMS -> Create dashboards from logs.
Eg - Health Dashboard, N/W Dashboard, S/W Dashboard.
Alarms and Notifications for errors and error tracking.
Libraries for these.
=============LOG MGMT SYSTEM=======

My Initiative:
1) Look into the exact process of Mongoose validation
2) Look into the purpose for request validation
3) Look into handling operational vs. non-operational errors and error messages.
