Develop the Prototype:
According to me, the prototype should have the following fields:
* firstName
* lastName
* dateOfBirth
* email
* username
* password
* phoneNumber

All format validation is to be done by express-validator, before request reaches mongoose.
Sanitisation for XSS is to be done by ?? library.

Put field level error messages on the built-in validator.
