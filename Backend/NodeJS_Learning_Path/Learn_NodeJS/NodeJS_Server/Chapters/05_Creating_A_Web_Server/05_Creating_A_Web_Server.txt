The server.listen() function listens for requests to the server on the given port.
The http.createServer() function is used to create a server.
The port is set to 3500.

A SERVER EXAMPLE:
	The response status code is set to 200.
	The response header is set to Content-Type, text/html.
	The file is read at the appropriate path.
	The response is ended by sending data.

The http.createServer() creates a server by returning an instance of http.Server().

The response.writeHead() function sends a response to the request.
It sends the response headers along with a statu code and a status message.

The response.end() method signals to the server that all of the response headers and body have been sent; 
That the server should consider this message complete. 
The method, response.end(), MUST be called on each response.

A BASIC SERVER:
	Get the extension from the request url.
	Determine the content type according to the extension.
	Determine the file path according to the content type.
	Check if the file exists in the determined file path.
	SERVE THE FILE:
		If the File Exists:
			Read the file
			Send the response headers and status using writeHead().
			Send the data using end().
		Else:
			Redirect using writeHead() to index.html
			Use end() to end the response.
