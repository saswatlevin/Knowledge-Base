===================================07 - MIDDLEWARE=====================================
Any thing that comes between the request and the response is called Middleware.
Route handlers may be considered to be a kind of middleware.
There are 3 types of middleware: Built-in, CUstom and Third Party.

app.use() is used to apply middleware.
Built-in middleware doesn't need to use next() explicitly. It is already included in it.
Custom middleware - created by us needs to use next().

Middleware is applied in the order in which app.use() statements are placed.
The "express.urlencoded()" middleware allows the server to accept form data.
The "express.json()" middleware allows the server to accept JSON data in the request body.
The "express.static()" middleware allows the server to render CSS and display images.

The logger logs all HTTP requests sent to the server.
The "req.method" is the HTTP method of the request.
The "req.headers.origin" tells us where the request came from.
The "req.url" is the URL of the request.
