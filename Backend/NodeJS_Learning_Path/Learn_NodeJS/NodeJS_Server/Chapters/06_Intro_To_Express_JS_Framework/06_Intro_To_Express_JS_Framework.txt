app.get() is a route handler.
app.get() routes HTTP GET requests to the specified path with the specified callback functions.

The res.sendFile() function does 2 things:
Transfers the file at the given path. 
Sets the Content-Type response HTTP header field based on the filenameâ€™s extension.

The res.redirect() function does the following:
Redirects to the URL derived from the specified path, with specified status code.
If no status code is specified, it uses the status code 302 (Found).

It contains 2 things: a route and an anonymous function which takes 2 arguments: a request and a response.
The route passed to route handlers can contain regular expressions.
The said anonymous function serves the page. It uses res.sendFile() to serve the page at the given path.

Other route handlers such as app.post(), app.put(), etc. exist too.
The anaonymous functions passed to those handlers perform actions other than serving a page.

Express.js is like a waterfall -> This means that when a request comes, the route handlers are checked in the order in which they are placed in the "server.js" file. 
When a matching route handler is found, the anonymous function in it is executed.

Route handlers can be chained together using the next() function.
The next() function just makes the flow of control go to the function immediately after the function in which next() was called.
