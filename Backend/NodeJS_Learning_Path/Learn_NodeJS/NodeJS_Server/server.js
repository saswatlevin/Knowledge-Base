//Express.js works like a waterfall. It first goes to a route '/', then to the route with '/index.html' and so on
// Wildcards can be included in the routes

// '$|/'   -> Ending with a /
// (text)? -> Doesn't include 'text'

// All the app.get(), app.post(), etc. are called Route Handlers. 

// Middleware is anything that goes between the request and the response.
// Route handlers are middleware.
// There are 3 types of middleware: built-in, custom and 3rd-party.
// app.use() is often used to apply middleware.

// Middleware also works like a waterfall. So, if we apply any middleware in a line that's above
// all routes, so that middleware will apply to all routes.

// Middleware is a list of actions that flows through one after another.
// The .use() function allows layers to be added to middleware.

// CORS is a HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme or port) other than its own
// from which a browser should permit loading resources
// It is a mechanism that allows servers to load resources from other origins' backends.
// Here, unless we add a site to this whitelist, we can't access our backedn (server) from that site.
